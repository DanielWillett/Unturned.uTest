Assemblies (.dll, .exe) will be wiped from this folder occasionally if they're not added by uTest.
This is done to allow removing assemblies from uTest's dependencies in the future.


If you're wondering why some of these are EXEs, its to avoid Unturned automatically discovering them and messing up functionality of other modules.
They are just renamed .dll files and running them will do nothing.
